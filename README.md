## Understanding the Project Structure ##

Right now there are 3 projects:

* **Web** - this is the UI
* **Core** - all of the request handlers / requests.  There shouldn't be any models in here; instead, put properties on the request object and use Automapper to go from the request -> data model
* **Data** - data access only, no handlers, models generated by TT file.
* **Test** - unit tests project

In the future we will add an API project that will interact with **Core**

## SpeakR Codes ##

Here's how I planned for codes to get generated at the start:

1. Use Rustflakes to generate a random unique integer
1. Convert the integer to hex
1. This should be unique enough to start

The request handler should be smart enough to generate the codes.
It's probably better for the codes to live in a separate table and be generated ahead of time so it's really just about picking one from the system.
